# Demand Side Sales

We are going to introduce three key frameworks for how people buy:
1. **The three sources of energy or motivation** (functional, emotional, and social)
2. **The four forces of progress** (push, pull, anxiety, and habit forces)
3. **The JTBD timeline** (sequence of events and actions to make progress)

## The Three Sources of Energy—Types of Motivations for Progress

There are three different categories of motivation: functional, emotional, and social. Think of it as the energy or fuel to make the buying process happen.

### 1. Functional Motivation

**Definition:** How cumbersome is the purchasing process for the buyer—time, effort, and speed? Think of mechanical things here: speed, effort, steps, etc.

**Example:** 
> Consider online students at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). These students were working full-time jobs while trying to go to school at night. They had little time to take the ACT/SAT and fill out a laborious application with an essay. They had no idea how to obtain a transcript. The decision to go back to school included these functional barriers that stood in the way. SNHU needed to reduce these functional barriers that were pushing students away from their services.

**Example (Basecamp):**
> Basecamp directly addresses functional barriers in project management: "Too many tools? Stuff scattered?" They promise that "10 seconds after you sign up, clarity sets in." Their copy emphasizes eliminating the functional friction of "overwhelming, inadequate, bewildering, or chaotic" project management systems. They reduce complexity by replacing multiple tools: "Basecamp replaces a whole set of separate products and saves you a ton of money. Basecamp has chat built in (no more Slack)... task management... (no more Asana)... store and share all the files you need (no more Dropbox)."

### 2. Emotional Motivation

**Definition:** What positive or negative internal thoughts are driving my purchase—fears, frustrations, and desires?

**Example:**
> The SNHU online students were not focused on the university's ranking. It was the vision of a better life that drove them to sacrifice their nights and weekends. They wanted to provide a better life for their family. SNHU's advertisements reflected this emotional journey—showing the struggling moment of working a dead-end job, the hard work required, and the better life ahead. The advertising focused on the emotional satisfaction students would feel when providing for their families.

**Example (Basecamp):**
> Basecamp taps into deep emotional frustrations: "Wrestling with projects? It doesn't have to be this hard." They acknowledge the emotional pain: "Even simple things feel like a grind?" The promise is emotional relief: a "calm, comfortable, simple starting point every morning." They validate the buyer's emotional journey: "You've probably tried some. Yet, here you are." The CEO's personal email offer (jason@basecamp.com) provides emotional reassurance through human connection.

### 3. Social Motivation

**Definition:** How do other people perceive, respect, trust, or acknowledge me?

**Example:**
> The SNHU online students wanted the feeling of pride that a diploma would create. They envisioned how proud their family and friends would be, and as a result, how proud they would feel about themselves. SNHU's advertising campaign highlighted this social dimension of achievement.

**Example (Basecamp):**
> Basecamp addresses social anxieties head-on: "Tired of looking disorganized in front of clients?" They promise to help teams "Be partners, not adversaries" with clients. Social proof is woven throughout: "Over 75,000 organizations, across every industry imaginable, in 166 countries." The testimonials carousel reinforces social validation: "Gold standard PM app," "Best app for teams." They even address internal team dynamics: "Reports give you confidence to hold people accountable."

---

**Overall Goal:** The goal in demand-side sales is to reduce the negative functional, emotional, and social motivations, which are causing anxiety and serving as a barrier. While at the same time, amplifying the positive motivations to create pull for the product or service.

## The Four Forces of Progress

One of the methods that we use to unpack causality are the forces of progress. The forces at play determine whether people can move from A to B and make progress. Will it be business as usual or a new path forward? Within the forces are things that *pull* people toward change and frictions that *push* them back to the old. Buying is not random!

### 1. The Push of the Situation

**Definition:** The current struggle or problem that makes someone consider change.

**Example:**
> If you think about the struggling moment for the person buying a mattress, it's about needing a better night's sleep. They are tossing and turning and it's affecting their productivity during the day—the push.

**Example (Basecamp):**
> Basecamp masterfully articulates the push: "Wrestling with projects and process?", "Team super busy, but running in circles?", "Info increasingly scattered across different apps?", "Subscription fees keep adding up?" Each question amplifies the struggling moment. They even validate the accumulation of push forces: "You wouldn't be here if the way you've been working was working."

### 2. The Magnetism of the New Solution

**Definition:** The attraction or pull of a new solution that promises to solve the problem.

**Example:**
> The moment you realize that something might bring you a better night's sleep and help you make progress, that solution creates magnetism and you start to imagine a better life with a good night's sleep. A friend buys a new mattress and raves to you about it. The pull toward progress.

**Example (Basecamp):**
> Basecamp creates pull through vivid contrasts: "Most project management systems are overwhelming... Basecamp is refreshingly straightforward." They paint a picture of the better life: "clarity sets in," "a calm, comfortable, simple starting point every morning," "Notice progress at a glance." The pull is reinforced with concrete visualizations showing organized projects, clear communication, and visual progress indicators.

### 3. The Anxiety of the New Solution

**Definition:** The fears and uncertainties about whether the new solution will work.

**Example:**
> Despite the problem and the pull the new solution creates, there's anxiety. Will the new mattress deliver on its promise? Can I even figure out which mattress is the best? What happens if I get the new mattress and I hate it? These anxieties hold people back from making the progress that they need.

**Example (Basecamp):**
> Basecamp systematically addresses anxieties: "21-year track record" (will they stick around?), "profitable for 25 straight years, we have zero debt" (are they stable?), "99.99% uptime" (is it reliable?), "Our customer support is widely considered to be among the best" (will I get help?). They offer a free trial, export capabilities ("as often as you'd like"), and even the CEO's personal email. The refund policy and "no questions asked" cancellation reduce switching anxiety.

### 4. The Habit of the Present

**Definition:** The comfort and familiarity with the current situation, even if it's not ideal.

**Example:**
> You are used to the old mattress, even though it sucks. You've learned to live with it. There's an energy in that incumbent solution that keeps you from making progress and stops you from switching.

**Example (Basecamp):**
> Basecamp acknowledges the habit force: "You've probably tried some. Yet, here you are." They don't fight email habits but integrate: "Email is fine if that's how some of your team prefers to work." They allow gradual adoption: "link up files from Google Docs, Figma, Dropbox" rather than forcing immediate abandonment of existing tools. The "No need to reinvent how you work" message respects current habits while offering improvement.

### The Forces Equation

The push of the situation and the magnetism of the new solution need to be stronger than their anxieties and habits before they will buy: 

### **(F1 + F2) > (F3 + F4)**

People only make progress when force one and force two are bigger than force three and force four. What we are taught in business school is to add more features, but the forces work as a system and sometimes more features is not better because it causes more anxiety. The ultimate thing is to see the way the customer buys as a system that plays out over a timeline.

## The Timeline for Progress

The forces and the motivations drive the buyer's decisions, but not in a vacuum. Like any good crime, there's a timeline. Through the years we've uncovered the six stages a buyer must walk through before making a purchase:

1. **First Thought** — creating the space in the brain
2. **Passive Looking** — learning
3. **Active Looking** — seeing the possibilities
4. **Deciding** — making the trade-offs and establishing value
5. **Onboarding** — the act of doing the JTBD, meeting expectations and delivering satisfaction and value
6. **Ongoing Use** — building the habit

There are events that move people along the timeline. When conducting interviews, we imagine the events in their life like huge dominoes falling. We need to understand the buyer at a very granular level. What happened that made them say, "Today's the day I am going to…"? We need to understand *causality*.

### 1. First Thought

**Definition:** The initial moment when someone recognizes they have a problem or need. Without this first thought, there's no place in the mind to file information about potential solutions.

**Example:**
> When you finally have that first thought: "I'm not sleeping well," or "This is a dead-end job." Whether you say it out loud, or you have it in your head, it's the critical first step for you to buy. Before this first step, there's not a place in your mind to file the information about mattresses or online universities.

**Example (Basecamp):**
> Basecamp's homepage immediately creates first thoughts through questions: "Wrestling with projects and process?" "Team super busy, but running in circles?" These questions plant the seed that current project management might be the problem. The statement "It doesn't have to be this hard" creates the mental space to consider alternatives. Without these questions, visitors might not connect their daily frustrations to their project management approach.

**Key Insight:** Once you have the first thought, you've opened up the space in your mind for the information. Without this first thought there is no demand.

**Four ways to create a first thought:**
- Ask a good question…and not give an answer
- Tell a story
- Give a new metric
- State the obvious

### 2. Passive Looking

**Definition:** The stage where you notice information related to your problem without actively seeking it. You're learning about the problem and potential solutions opportunistically.

**Example:**
> You notice the mattress store when you pass it now. You drive past a local university and wonder if they have online classes. You have passed these places every day without a second thought, but now, like Clay Christensen said, the questions in your head create spaces to file this information.

**Example (Basecamp):**
> Basecamp acknowledges passive looking with "You've probably tried some. Yet, here you are." They know visitors have been noticing project management pain points and tools. The copy "most project management systems are either overwhelming, inadequate, bewildering, or chaotic" shows they understand what passive lookers have observed. The phrase "You wouldn't be here if the way you've been working was working" validates the passive looking journey.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Learning the problem and the language
- Taking the temperature of people around you
- Usually done alone and opportunistically
- No effort, time, or money set aside yet
- The moment people start planning, they move to active looking

### 3. Active Looking

**Definition:** When people actively plan and invest time, effort, and money to find a solution. They need options (but not too many) as reference points to build their ideal solution.

**Key Elements:**
- People start to invest time, effort, and thought
- They notice discrete features and attributes
- They start connecting dots to frame future tradeoffs
- Divergent thinking and eliminating options

**Critical Trigger:** A "time wall" — an artificial or real deadline that forces action. Without a time wall, people might look forever.

**Example:**
> Active looking is when people plan, or spend time and even money figuring out what's next—the solution to their struggling moment. In order to make progress and move forward people need options, but not too many, as a reference point. These options allow them to start to build an ideal solution in their mind.

**Example (Basecamp):**
> Basecamp supports active looking with concrete comparisons: "Basecamp has chat built in (no more Slack)... task management... (no more Asana)... store and share all the files you need (no more Dropbox)." They provide reference points against familiar tools. The detailed product walkthrough, video demonstrations, and live classes cater to active lookers who need to understand features. The "Watch a video" and "Join a live class" options give multiple ways to actively explore.

### 4. Deciding

**Definition:** The stage where people make explicit tradeoffs and decide what they're willing to give up to make progress. No ideal solution exists—every customer makes tradeoffs.

**Key Insights:**
- People need to reject something before they can buy something else
- Understanding what people are willing to give up is the most powerful insight
- Expectations for satisfaction are cemented during this stage
- Value is defined here
- Everything in the future is measured against these expectations

**Example:**
> People will say they want the top-of-the-line mattress, or the best kitchen cabinets and countertops, but when it comes down to it, nobody gets everything they want.

**Example (Basecamp):**
> Basecamp helps with deciding by being explicit about tradeoffs: "Basecamp is for makers, not micromanagers." They're clear about what they don't do: no Gantt charts, no time tracking built-in. The pricing is transparent with "You pay $229 once, no matter the size of your company." They address specific deciding questions: "Can I prevent our clients from seeing unfinished work?" The export feature ("as often as you'd like") reduces the fear of being locked in.

### 5. Onboarding

**Definition:** The "big hire" — the first use of the product or service where consumers determine if you've met the expectations set during the deciding stage.

**Key Points:**
- Where the rubber hits the road
- Expectations from deciding stage are now poured in concrete
- First use is measured against expectations
- Critical for preventing buyer's remorse
- If metrics set in deciding were wrong, dissatisfaction occurs

**Example:**
> In onboarding, the consumer is having their first use of the product or service and measuring that against their expectations to see if they bought what they think they bought.

**Example (Basecamp):**
> Basecamp sets clear onboarding expectations: "10 seconds after you sign up, clarity sets in." They offer multiple onboarding paths: tutorial videos, live classes, and "expert specialists" for support. The promise of immediate clarity manages expectations. They emphasize the support quality: "Our customer support is widely considered to be among the best in the business." The Getting Started Guide and personal check-ins ensure the first experience matches promises.

### 6. Ongoing Use

**Definition:** The repeated "little hires" where consumers incorporate the product into their everyday life and continually assess if it's doing the job.

**Key Distinctions:**
- Different from buying and onboarding
- Series of repeated evaluations
- Where jobs actually get done and progress is achieved
- Poor performance leads to new struggling moments

**Example:**
> As a simple example, let's use Windex. Onboarding, the big hire, is buying the bottle of Windex and the first use of the product. Ongoing use, little hires, is squirting the bottle of Windex as part of your routine cleaning. How well does it work over time?

**Example (Basecamp):**
> Basecamp reinforces ongoing use through continuous improvement: "we've been improving it weekly ever since." The newsletter keeps users engaged with updates. Their commitment shows in "built to stay, not exit" and being "profitable for 25 straight years." The emphasis on becoming "a calm, comfortable, simple starting point every morning" describes the desired ongoing use pattern. Daily features like Hill Charts help users track progress continuously, reinforcing the value in each "little hire."

## How Basecamp Exemplifies Demand Side Sales

Basecamp's marketing copy demonstrates masterful application of DSS principles:

### 1. **Starting with the Struggle**
Rather than leading with features, Basecamp opens with the customer's struggling moment: "Wrestling with projects and process?" This immediately creates resonance with visitors experiencing project management pain.

### 2. **Addressing All Three Motivations**
- **Functional:** "Too many tools? Stuff scattered?" (reducing complexity)
- **Emotional:** "It doesn't have to be this hard" (promising relief)
- **Social:** "Tired of looking disorganized in front of clients?" (professional reputation)

### 3. **Managing the Four Forces**
Basecamp systematically amplifies push and pull while reducing anxiety and respecting habits:
- Amplifies push through vivid problem articulation
- Creates pull with promises of "clarity" and "calm"
- Reduces anxiety with 21-year track record and free trials
- Respects habits by allowing email integration and gradual adoption

### 4. **Supporting the Entire Timeline**
From creating first thoughts with provocative questions to reinforcing ongoing use with continuous improvements, Basecamp's copy guides buyers through each stage of their journey.

### 5. **Understanding Trade-offs**
By explicitly stating "Basecamp is for makers, not micromanagers" and being clear about what they don't offer (Gantt charts, built-in time tracking), they help customers make informed decisions about trade-offs.

The result is marketing copy that doesn't just describe a product—it demonstrates deep understanding of how and why customers switch to new solutions, addressing the complete emotional and practical journey from first thought through ongoing use.
