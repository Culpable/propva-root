# PropVA - Property Portfolio Management

PropVA turns document chaos into crystal-clear financial intelligence for landlords. Upload a rent statement, council rates invoice or loan statement and a layered AI stack extracts every figure, verifies accuracy, and files it against the correct property. The moment data is saved, dashboards recalculate yields, ROI, equity growth and tax position—so you always know exactly how each asset is performing.

Designed for Australian investors, PropVA groups everything by financial year, flags deductible expenses, and links every number back to its source document. Whether you self-manage two units or oversee a ten-house portfolio through a manager, the interface stays simple: drag-and-drop, quick confirm, instant insight.

Because the heavy lifting happens behind the scenes—OCR, AI validation, loan maths—you spend your time making decisions, not spreadsheets. Export a clean report for your accountant or drill into a single expense with one click; either way, the figures are ready when you are.

## Effortless data capture

- One-click confirmation; edits are inline, then everything syncs to the dashboard.
- **Lightning-fast search** – Find any property, transaction or document instantly with our intelligent search (Cmd+K) that understands what you're looking for, not just exact text matches.

## Real-time performance reporting

- **ROI & yield cards** – net rental yield, cash-on-cash return and lifetime ROI calculated automatically per property and for the whole portfolio.
- **YTD/Full Year toggle** – Switch between Year-to-Date progress (Jan-today) and full Financial Year projections (Jul-Jun) to see current performance or annual forecasts.
- **Growth tracking** – year-on-year income growth, expense drift and equity build plotted in plain line charts with trend indicators showing if you're ahead or behind last year.
- **Capital efficiency** – interest vs principal split, interest-cover ratio, loan-to-value trends.
- **Financial-year view** – flip between FYs; taxable income, deduction totals and projected tax update instantly.
- **Comparative insights** – rank properties by yield, vacancy impact, maintenance cost per square metre and more.

## Comprehensive property management

- **Property information tabs** – manage all property details in one place:
  - Overview dashboard with key metrics and alerts
  - Finance tracking with automated LVR calculations and loan management
  - Insurance monitoring with expiry reminders
  - Property manager details with ABN verification
  - Ownership structure supporting multiple owners with percentage splits
  - Lease management with automatic rent conversions (weekly/fortnightly/monthly)
- **Smart validation** – real-time formatting, automatic calculations, and intelligent defaults reduce data entry errors.
- **Background intelligence** – tabs preload in the background for instant switching; frequently accessed data stays cached for speed.

## Simplicity first

- Clear, uncluttered layout: colour-coded cards, big numbers, plain English labels.
- Quick search and filters: type "insurance Aug 2025" or pick a property to jump straight to the data.
- Recurring rent and loan entries record themselves—set once, forget.
- Original documents stay one click away, so audits and bank queries take moments.

**Result**: upload, confirm, and immediately understand ROI, growth and yield for every property—no manual maths, just seamless clarity.
