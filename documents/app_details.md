# Propva - Property Portfolio Management

Propva turns document chaos into crystal-clear financial intelligence for landlords. Upload a rent statement, council rates invoice or loan statement and a layered AI stack extracts every figure, verifies accuracy, and files it against the correct property. The moment data is saved, dashboards recalculate yields, ROI, equity growth and tax position—so you always know exactly how each asset is performing.

Designed for Australian investors, Propva groups everything by financial year, flags deductible expenses, and links every number back to its source document. Whether you self-manage two units or oversee a ten-house portfolio through a manager, the interface stays simple: drag-and-drop, quick confirm, instant insight.

Because the heavy lifting happens behind the scenes—OCR, AI validation, loan maths—you spend your time making decisions, not spreadsheets. Export a clean report for your accountant or drill into a single expense with one click; either way, the figures are ready when you are.

## Real-time performance reporting

- **Growth tracking** – year-on-year income growth, expense drift and equity build plotted in plain line charts.
- **Capital efficiency** – interest vs principal split, interest-cover ratio, loan-to-value trends.
- **Financial-year view** – flip between FYs; taxable income, deduction totals and projected tax update instantly.
- **Comparative insights** – rank properties by yield, vacancy impact, maintenance cost per square metre and more.
- **Export in seconds** – produce a clean CSV or accountant-ready PDF; every figure links back to its document.

## Simplicity first

- Clear, uncluttered layout: colour-coded cards, big numbers, plain English labels.
- Quick search and filters: type "insurance Aug 2025" or pick a property to jump straight to the data.
- Recurring rent and loan entries record themselves—set once, forget.
- Original documents stay one click away, so audits and bank queries take moments.

**Result**: upload, confirm, and immediately understand ROI, growth and yield for every property—no manual maths, just seamless clarity.
